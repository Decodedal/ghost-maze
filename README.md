# ghost-maze

_A browser game where you help a character navigate their way out of a haunted maze._

## Game Logic

```
The player will control the character with the arrow keys. 
Your character cant pass through walls 
Their will be a time limit in which the player must complete the maze.
players will be able to collect items which will add time to the game timer. 
players should avaoid obsticles which will make the timer speed up. 
If the player reaches the end of the maze before the time is up the remaining time is calculated into a score and the player moves on to the next level of the game or comletes the game. 

```
### MVP Criteria

- character is controlable and can not pass beyond the boundery of a wall.
- The game has collectable items which the user must get to unlock the maze while avoiding enemys. 

### Post-MVP Plans

- want to have collectables that will increse the timer and monsters that will depleate the timer. 

- want the levels to appear in full at the start and then become shrowded in darkness. The only visable parts of the game will be a parimiter that surrounds the player. 

- want the levels to be auto generating so you can play an unlimited number of unique levels.
